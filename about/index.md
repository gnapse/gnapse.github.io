title: About me

I'm Ernesto Garc√≠a, I'm from Cuba, and I work developing software at
[Continuum][] in Chile.  You can find me as **@gnapse** in most online
services.

I currently work mostly on web and mobile platforms, with a strong preference
for modern dynamic languages, such as Ruby, Python, Java and Objective-C.  I
also enjoy a lot working in unix-like environments, and around the command
line and Vim, two places where I feel increasingly at home.

When I'm not there, you'll probably find me listening to some music, watching a
good film, or spending some time with my wife, my family and my friends.  And
any of those activities is more pleasant when accompanied by a nice meal, some
beer or some wine, depending on the mood or the weather.

## About this website

This website is developed with [jekyll][], and hosted using [github pages][].
You can check it out [here][].

The template is developed by me, slightly based on the default layout provided
by jekyll, but with a complete redesign of the stylesheets.  It features an
[atom feed][], and dedicated stylesheets for mobile and printing media.

Feel free to use the template in your own website, and modify it as you see
fit.  In case you use it, a link back to this website would be appreciated, but
it's not required.
