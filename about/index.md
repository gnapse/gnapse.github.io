I'm Ernesto Garc√≠a, I'm from Cuba, and I work developing software at
[Continuum][] in Chile.  You can find me as **@gnapse** in most online
services.

I currently work mostly on web and mobile platforms, with a strong preference
for modern dynamic languages, such as Ruby, Python, Java and Objective-C.  I
also enjoy a lot working in unix-like environments, and around the command
line and Vim, two places where I feel increasingly at home.

When I'm not there, you'll probably find me listening to some music, watching a
good film, or spending some time with my wife, my family and my friends.  And
any of those activities is more pleasant when accompanied by a nice meal, some
beer or some wine, depending on the mood or the weather.
