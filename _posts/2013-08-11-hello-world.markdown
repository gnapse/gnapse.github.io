I'm starting this new blog as an experiment on using [jekyll][] for blogging
from the terminal.  It is a natural next step after my workflow has gravitated
more and more towards the command line and Vim in the last few months.

[Jekyll][] is all I ever wanted, but never knew I did, from a blogging engine.
No server-side overhead, no platform or server technology lock-down, just plain
old HTML, like it was meant to be.  Admittedly, is not a tool for everyone, but
it is the most natural one for a hacker's lifestyle.

It is my hope that this will grow out of the experiment status and into a full
grown blog, a space for my ramblings, if you will.  Tech-related subjects,
specially about programming, should be the norm.
