# My personal website

This started as an experiment on using [jekyll][] for blogging from the
terminal.  It is a natural next step after my workflow has gravitated more and
more towards the command line and Vim in the last few months.

The template is developed by me, slightly based on the default layout provided
by jekyll, but with a complete redesign of the stylesheets.  It features an
atom feed, and dedicated stylesheets for mobile and printing media.
